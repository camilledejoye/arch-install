# Arch scripts

This repository is where I store the scripts I can use to install and or deploy Arch Linux.
The goal is to be able to easily install a new Arch setup or setting up an existing one.

## New installation

See the [dedicated documentation](doc/new-install.md) for a new installation.
It will include a basic reminder of the steps to install an Arch distribution and how to run the scripts.
